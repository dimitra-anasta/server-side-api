## Description

For this assignment, I created a Weather Dashboard. It was to have a search bar, a large display of the city's weather on that specific day, and below it a 5 day weather forecast.

## Installation

I created my HTML and Javascript. I used bootstrap to create the search bar, button, and the list on cities below it. I also used bootstrap to create the jumbotron that displays the weather of today's forecast, and the 5 day forecast cards below it. I used OpenWeather for the two weather API's. The most challenging part of this assignment was the API segment and understanding how to make it work with my HTML. I had to use the console to find the parent and child values to get the correct data to appear for each section.
